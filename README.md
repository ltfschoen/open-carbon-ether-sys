# Open carbon ether system

Status : Work in progress, created for the Future Cities project

## Overview

The Open carbon initiative aims to provide a fully transparent and distributed ledger to track carbon emissions. Today world over, the carbon emission calculations are widely based on approximations
and there is no concrete way to measure and trace an individuals contribution to overall carbon footprint.

This proposal aims to minimize the approximation factor surrounding measurement of carbon emissions drastically and also enable each person to track the carbon emissions that they are personally
responsible for. Hopefully, this would encourage a majority of the population to take responsibility for their actions that contribute to the decline of the ecosystem and take appropriate
actions.

## Steps to achieve this

In today's world, its very difficult to lead a lifestyle where a person is not responsible for any Carbon emissions but it is possible to amend one's lifestyle to minimize the amount of emissions
as much as practically possible. Almost everything that one does in his / her daily life would result in some amount carbon emissions - cooking, heating, electricity, transport, eating are some daily activities
that we take for granted but the truth is that each of these activities contribute to the overall carbon footprint.

For the purposes of this proposal we will be focusing on the carbon emissions that result from the energy usage in our house holds and how we can leverage emerging technologies like Internet of Things (IOT)
and Blockchain to measure and track an individuals contribution to the overall carbon footprint. In addition to tracking and measurement, we propose to incentivise players who act responsibly and  
minimise their carbon emissions by rewarding them and penalize actors who act irresponsibly and exceed the permissible carbon emission limit for an individual / household.

### Step 1 - Gain ownership of data

The big energy companies measure the carbon emission data of a household that they supply and also provide this information as part of their bill statement or online account dashboard. See example belo,

but this data is centralized and is owned by the energy supplier. The first step to achieving transparency is to remove the centralization of this data and put this on an open decentralized and distributed
platform. There will be a mechanism in place to manage data privacy but higher level access will be available for government agencies.

This will be well served by leveraging the capabilities of Blockchain technology.

### Step 2 - Build integration systems to input data to the platform



### TODO - Impl

* [ ] Smart Contract - Read data from hardcoded usage value and compare that data to a threshold (if nearing end of month) and issue tokens
* [ ] Setup IPFS to work locally
* [ ] Smart Contract - Replace hardcoded placeholder with IPFS value
